# Locations

Currently **Melbourne** is the only city with a regular bitdevs meetup.

There are plans for a Perth meetup, and desires for meetups in other cities.

If you'd like to start a meetup in your city, please reach out!

# Melbourne Bitdevs

Melbourne Bitdevs is on the last thursday of every month at the **RMIT Blockchain Hub**.

As a group, we discuss the latest Bitcoin news from a technical perspective. Sometimes we diverge into adjacent fields of privacy, self hosting, free software, and more!

**[Join the telegram](https://t.me/+jKSVmXSvGvViNzBl) to join our group, confirm event details - and be let upstairs!**

Please ping someone if joining approval is taking too long!

## News items for this month

Please suggest any noteworthy topics for next month in the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/MelbourneBitDevs/MelbBitDevs/issues)! We're open to discussing pretty much anything Bitcoin or Bitcoin-adjacent!

## Things to note

Attendence is often larger than meetup page RSVPs.

This event is not streamed online, to preserve free discussion, atmosphere, engagement, and community.

To facillitate optimal free and open discussion, privacy of attendees is taken seriously, absolutely no photos/recordings without explicit consent from all parties. [Chatham house rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule) applies.
